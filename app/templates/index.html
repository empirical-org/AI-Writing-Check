      <p>ðŸ‘‹ Educators, AI Writing Check is a free service developed by Quill.org and CommonLit.org to enable educators to check if a piece of writing submitted by a student was written by the AI tool ChatGPT. This algorithm is designed to detect AI-generated writing. </p>

      <p>We estimate, based on testing with 15k essays, that this tool is accurate 80-90% of the time. For this reason, we'd like to encourage teachers to exercise caution when using this tool to detect academic dishonesty. AI Writing Check is a stopgap tool measure for educators to use this school year until more advanced AI detection tools are made widely available. </p>

      <p>To check responses longer than 400 words, you must separate the text into individual sections.</p>

        Quill.org & CommonLit created this to help educators build writing skills
      </div>
      <div class='text'>
        <p>Quill.org & CommonLit are nonprofit educational technology organizations dedicated to helping 3rd - 12th grade students become stronger writers. Quill.org provides writing activities that use AI to provide students with immediate feedback and coaching, enabling them to continually revise their work and build their skills. CommonLit provides reading activities and a full-year ELA curriculum for grades 6-10.</p>

        <p>Quill.org and CommonLit deeply believe that every student needs to be a strong writer to succeed in school and careers, and technology can help build these writing skills. To achieve this mission, both of our nonprofits provided our activities for free to all educators and students.</p>
