        <p>ðŸ‘‹ Educators, AI Writing Check is a free service developed by Quill.org and CommonLit.org to enable educators to check if a piece of writing submitted by a student was written by the AI tool ChatGPT. This algorithm is designed to detect AI-generated writing. </p>

        <p>We estimate, based on testing with 15k essays, that this tool is accurate 80-90% of the time. For this reason, we'd like to encourage teachers to exercise caution when using this tool to detect academic dishonesty. AI Writing Check is a stopgap tool measure for educators to use this school year until more advanced AI detection tools are made widely available. </p>

        <p>To check responses longer than 400 words, you must separate the text into individual sections.</p>

          Educators, we created a toolkit to help you talk about AI plagiarism with your students
        </h3>

          <p>With the introduction of this new technology, students are curious about how to use it. We believe that if students use AI tools as research tools, and properly cite it as a source, it can help students learn about new ideas. However, when students pass off AI generated writing as their own, they are not engaging in the critical process of building their own writing skills. To help you set the right expectations with your students and navigate these conversations, we created a toolkit.</p>

          We created AI Writing Check to support strong writing education for students
        </h3>

          <p>Quill.org & CommonLit are nonprofit educational technology organizations dedicated to helping 3rd - 12th grade students become stronger writers. Quill.org provides writing activities that use AI to provide students with immediate feedback and coaching, enabling them to continually revise their work and build their skills. CommonLit provides interactive reading and writing activities, and a full English Language Arts curriculum to support literacy development in grades 6-12.</p>

          <p>Quill.org and CommonLit deeply believe that every student needs to be a strong writer to succeed in school and careers, and technology can help build these writing skills. To achieve this mission, both of our nonprofits provided our activities for free to all educators and students.</p>
